This is an unofficial implementation of the paper [Privacy Auditing with One (1) Training Run](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08846).

# Requirements

Install and activate the conda environment in environment.yml:

```bash
micromamba env create -f environment.yml -n privacy-audit
micromamba activate privacy-audit
```

# How to run

1. first train the model using the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/dp_train.sh
```

Note: we find that the training process heavily depends on the random seed, so the result may vary. Thus, we train 32 models and report the average epsilon.

At default, the epsilon is set to 100, which is a very large value. You can change it to a smaller value to 7 in the `scripts/dp_train.sh` file.

This code only supports the Input Space Attacks, and the Gradient Space Attacks are not implemented. 



2. then run the following command to audit the model:
```bash
bash scripts/dp_audit.sh
```



# Results
Here at default, the epsilon is set to 100. 
$k_+$ is set to 80, and $k_-$ is set as range(10, 200, 10). You may tune the hyperparameters to get better results. 

The result is as follows:

```

Since the epsilon is set to 100, the result is pretty loose here.
